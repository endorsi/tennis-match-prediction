# tennis-match-prediction
Developed machine learning models using several features to predict the tennis match results

The model has %76 test accuracy, which is %11 higher accuracy than simply predicting the favorite player(%65).
I bet on 40 matches using my model. The model got %72.5 accuracy (29/49), which is %5 higher accuracy than the favorite player model (%67.5 , 27/40).
